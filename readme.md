# Flashcard-o-matic
## Discover The Flashcard Difference.

This Flashcard-o-matic Application was created using React and Bootstrap 4.
This app allows users to create their very own double-sided flashcards and decks!
The intention of these flashcards is to help the user memorize and learn any concepts they wish to learn.

The current build only works locally.

[Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) led me to create this application as part of their curriculum to demostrate my understanding of React and how to effectively use various tools in React, such as useState and useEffect.

To initialize, fork and clone this reponsitry, run `npm install` and then `npm start`, `npm start` will start both the application and local server to store your deck and card information.
